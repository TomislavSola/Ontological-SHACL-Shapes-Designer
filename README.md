# SHACLEditor

Running the App.py script or the App.exe executable in the "dist" folder opens a SHACL Shapes editor that helps you create SHACL shapes based on uploaded ontologies. To run the script, the dependencies defined in the "environment.yml" file must be installed. For this purpose, I recommend using Anaconda as a package manager and setting up a new fresh Python environment using the following command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
